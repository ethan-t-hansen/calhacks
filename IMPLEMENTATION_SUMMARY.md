# Implementation Summary: Live Editing and AI Suggestions

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Collaborative Editing

#### Frontend (`apps/web/app/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx`)

- Changed `yjs-update` emit event to `update` to match server expectations
- Changed `yjs-update` listener to `yjs` to match server broadcast
- Fixed event name in cleanup function from `yjs-update` to `yjs`
- Added null check for `bounds` to fix TypeScript linting errors

#### Backend (`apps/api/src/room/controller.ts`)

- Added `handleSyncRequest` function to respond to client sync requests with current document state
- Fixed `handleUpdate` to properly convert array updates to Uint8Array
- Modified `handleUpdate` to broadcast `{ update }` object instead of full data object

#### Backend (`apps/api/src/room/router.ts`)

- Imported `handleSyncRequest` from controller
- Registered `yjs-sync-request` socket event handler

#### Backend (`apps/api/src/completion/router.ts`)

- Fixed chat socket handler to pass `socket` instead of `io`
- Removed commented-out unused socket handlers

### 2. Implemented AI Text Suggestion Feature

#### Frontend (`apps/web/app/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx`)

- Integrated `SuggestionToolbar` and `SuggestionDiff` components
- Added hooks: `useSuggestions` and `useStreamingSuggestion`
- Added state management for:
    - Toolbar visibility and position
    - Text selection tracking
    - Current suggestion with original/suggested text
    - Diff popup position
- Added Quill selection-change handler to show toolbar when text is selected
- Implemented `handleRequestSuggestion` to fetch streaming AI suggestions
- Implemented `handleAcceptSuggestion` to apply suggestions via Quill API
- Implemented `handleRejectSuggestion` to dismiss suggestions

#### Suggestion UI Components (Already Created)

- `SuggestionToolbar.tsx`: Shows input and button near selected text
- `SuggestionDiff.tsx`: Displays word-by-word diff with accept/reject buttons
- `useStreamingSuggestion.ts`: Handles streaming fetch from `/completions/suggest`
- `useSuggestions.ts`: Manages suggestion state and overlap detection

#### Dependencies (`apps/web/package.json`)

- Added `diff`: "^7.0.0" for text diffing
- Added `@types/diff`: "^6.0.0" for TypeScript support
- Added `yjs`: "^13.6.21" (was missing)

## How It Works

### Collaborative Editing Flow

1. Client connects and joins document room
2. Client requests sync via `yjs-sync-request` with state vector
3. Server responds with `yjs-sync-response` containing document update
4. Client applies update to local Yjs document
5. Local edits trigger Yjs update event
6. Client emits `update` event to server
7. Server broadcasts `yjs` event to other clients in room
8. Other clients apply update to their Yjs documents

### AI Suggestion Flow

1. User selects text in editor
2. Toolbar appears with prompt input
3. User enters prompt or uses default "improve this writing"
4. Frontend POSTs to `/completions/suggest` with streaming
5. Suggestion accumulates and displays in diff popup
6. User reviews word-by-word diff (green=added, red=removed)
7. On accept: Quill deletes original text and inserts suggestion
8. Quill change triggers Yjs update, broadcasts to other clients
9. On reject: Suggestion dismissed, selection cleared

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install

cd ../api
npm install
```

### Start Servers

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run dev

cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

### Test Collaborative Editing

1. Open two browser windows to the same document
2. Type in one window
3. Verify text appears in other window in real-time

### Test AI Suggestions

1. Open document editor
2. Select some text
3. Enter a prompt in the toolbar (or use default)
4. Click "Suggest"
5. Watch suggestion stream in
6. Review the diff
7. Click "Accept" to apply or "Reject" to dismiss
8. Use Ctrl+Z to undo accepted changes

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files

- `apps/web/app/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx` (major changes)
- `apps/api/src/room/controller.ts` (added handleSyncRequest, fixed handleUpdate)
- `apps/api/src/room/router.ts` (registered sync handler)
- `apps/api/src/completion/router.ts` (fixed chat handler)
- `apps/web/package.json` (added dependencies)

### Existing Files (Already Created, Not Modified)

- `apps/web/app/components/SuggestionToolbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/components/SuggestionDiff.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/hooks/useStreamingSuggestion.ts`
- `apps/web/app/hooks/useSuggestions.ts`

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

1. Suggestion position calculation could be improved for scrolled content
2. Toolbar hides when clicking outside - might want to add explicit close button
3. Could add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+K to trigger suggestion)
4. Could persist suggestion history to database
5. Could add multiple concurrent suggestions support
6. Could add suggestion confidence scoring
